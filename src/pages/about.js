            Hello! Here we are creating an app that would be just like Yelp, but for merchandises instead. No more wasting time surfing online reading reviews from different websites (Many websites are paid to write good/bad reviews for products). 
            </p>
            <p>
              This would be an all-in-one app that would allow consumers to read and write reviews for a variety of products. Literally for any merchandise. The ultimate goal is to collect as much real user-experience reviews to create an unbiased ranking of "the best" products out there.
            </p>
